# Competitive Programming Java Project

This project contains solutions to various competitive programming questions, each in its own Java class with a `main` method for easy execution.

## Structure
- All solutions are in `src/main/java/cp/`
- Each question is a separate class (e.g., `Question1.java`, `Question2.java`)
- Run any solution using: `./gradlew run --args='cp.Question1'` (replace with desired class)

## How to Add a New Question
1. Create a new Java file in `src/main/java/cp/`.
2. Implement your solution with a `main` method.
3. Commit and push your changes.

## Example Questions
- Find maximum number in an array
- Check if a string is a palindrome
